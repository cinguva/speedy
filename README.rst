*ðŸ¤–  Start ngrok**

In order for Slack to contact your local server, you'll need to run a tunnel. We
recommend ngrok or localtunnel. We're going to use ngrok for this example.

If you don't have ngrok, `download it here`_.

.. _download it here: https://ngrok.com


Here's a rudimentary diagream of how ngrok allows Slack to connect to your server

ðŸ’¡  Slack requires event requests be delivered over SSL, so you'll want to
    use the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok.

Run ngrok and copy the **HTTPS** URL

.. code::

  ngrok http 3000

.. code::

  ngrok by @inconshreveable (Ctrl+C to quit)

  Session status                      online
  Version                             2.1.18
  Region                  United States (us)
  Web Interface        http://127.0.0.1:4040

  Forwarding http://h7465j.ngrok.io -> localhost:9292
  Forwarding https://h7465j.ngrok.io -> localhost:9292

**ðŸ¤–  Run the app:**

You'll need to have your server and ngrok running to complete your app's Event
Subscription setup

.. code::

  python app.py


**ðŸ¤–  Subscribe your app to events**

Add your **Request URL** (your ngrok URL + ``/slack/events``) and subscribe your app to `message.channels` under bot events. **Save** and toggle **Enable Events** to `on`

**ðŸŽ‰  Once your app has been installed and subscribed to Bot Events, you will begin receiving event data from Slack**

**ðŸ‘‹  Interact with your bot:**

Invite your bot to a public channel, then paste ticket url and your bot will respond.
